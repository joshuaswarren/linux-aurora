//! Kernel tile-hazard backstop (`g17p_tile_backstop`).
//!
//! The hardware loads and stores whole tiles. Two render pass instances
//! that write pixel-disjoint parts of one attachment need no barrier in
//! Vulkan, but when their render areas share a tile and they run at the same
//! time on two render pairs, the later one can reload the tile before the
//! earlier one stored it and write stale pixels back (tilewaw, 2026-10-02:
//! 480 pixel-disjoint 13x11 passes on one image). Mesa orders such passes
//! within a queue (agx3 1a57a3b1168 era fix: cmdbuf, cmdbufs and submits
//! 0/50), but it cannot see a second VkQueue (`queues`, 50/50 corrupt) or a
//! second process sharing the image through dma-buf (`xproc`, 46/50).
//!
//! The kernel sees, per render, the fragment attachment spans it validates
//! (`validate_attachments`, whole image planes as Mesa reports them). It
//! cannot see render areas, so it treats any two in-flight renders whose
//! spans overlap as possibly sharing a tile:
//!   A. every render holding a physical pair lease is recorded with its
//!      owner (logical queue), render sequence and footprint;
//!   B. same owner, overlapping, and not ordered by the render's own prefix
//!      (`wait_through`): publish it on the conflicting render's pair, whose
//!      queue order then serializes the two (`SAME_OWNER`);
//!   C. different owner, overlapping: wait for that render to complete --
//!      its lease is released before its fence signals -- through the
//!      registry's lease condvar, bounded by `WAIT_CAP_MS` (`CROSS_OWNER`).
//!      A waiting render is recorded as pending with an arrival ticket, and
//!      a newer render of another owner that overlaps it waits behind it, so
//!      one busy queue cannot starve the other past the cap;
//!   D. different process: spans inside bindings of shareable (non
//!      VM-private) GEM objects are also recorded as (object, offset range),
//!      which two VMs mapping one dma-buf share, so C applies across VMs.
//! Correctly synchronized clients never have two overlapping renders in
//! flight from different queues (a semaphore wait retires the first before
//! the second runs), and barrier-ordered renders of one queue are ordered
//! by their prefix, so neither is affected. Nothing waits or moves unless
//! footprints overlap; the cost otherwise is one comparison pass over the
//! in-flight records under the lease mutex.
